<button id = "pyruvatebutton2">2</button>
<div class = "divpyruvatebutton2">The remaining 2-carbon fragment undergoes an oxidizing reaction as their electrons are transferred to NAD<sup>+</sup>, reducing it to NADH.</div>

<div class = "divpyruvatebutton3">Finally, coenzyme A (CoA), a sulfur-containing compound which comes from Vitamin B<sub>5</sub>, is attached to the two-carbon intermediate, forming Acetyl-CoA.</div>

<button id = "ace-button">Acetyl-CoA</button>
<div class = "divacebutton">This came directly from pyruvate oxidation. Acetyl-CoA adds its acetyl group (2-carbon fragment) to oxaloacetate, initiating the cycle. This forms citrate, a 6-carbon molecule.</div>

<button id = "GDP-button">GTP &larr; GDP</button>
<div class = "divGDPbutton">GTP is formed from GDP + a displacement of a phosphate group. GTP is functionally similar to ATP and it can be used to form ATP as well. This step produces 1 ATP per Acetyl-CoA.</div>
