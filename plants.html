<h3>Light Reaction
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Occurs in the thylakoid inside the chloroplast</li>
  <li>Uses solar energy to make ATP AND NADPH</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dark Reaction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Occurs in the stroma inside the chloroplast</li>
<li>Uses the ATP and NADPH produced in the previous reaction to incorporate CO<sub>2</sub>molecules into organic molecules, forming G3P (sugar).</li>
</ul>

    <ol>
    <li>Photon of light strikes one of the pigment molecules in a light harvesting complex in PS II, exciting an electron to a higher energy level.</li>
    <li>This electron is captured by primary electron acceptor and is transporting through the ETC.</li>
    <li>A water molecule is split into 2 electrons with their H<sup>+</sup> by an enzyme, and the oxygen atom combines instantly with another to produce the byproduct, O<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    <li>The photoexcited electron travels from PS II to PS I, establishing the proton gradient (higher inside thylakoid space).</li>
    <li>In PS I, another photon of light excites the electron to a higher eneergy level, captured by ferodoxin (Fd) then transferred to NADP<sup>+</sup>, making NADPH.</li>
    <li>This process continues as light keeps on exciting electrons donated by H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
